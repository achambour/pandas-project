# Pandas project: Jeopardy

A practical application of python's library pandas for data analysis.

The project deals with a database in CSV format: 'Jeopardy.csv' containing information about the shows of the Jeopardy game: date of the show, round, category of questions, questions, answers etc...

A careful analysis was made on the data using multiple python functions while exploring the pandas library. The main goal was to be able to parse through the 'question' strings and identify those that contain the given word(s) stored in a list. With this, interesting trends were taken out of the raw data such as: significantly more questions asked in the 2000s contained the word "Computer" than those asked in the 90s. In addition, aggregate statistics were also calculated such as the mean value of the questions containing the given word. Lastly, a small quizz based on the Jeopardy game was coded for the user.
